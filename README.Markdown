### Warning! This is currently pre-Alpha software

ARV Stats is being created to give Remote Viewers and Project Managers who practice ARV an accesible and easy to use online program for project creation, management and participation.

Things are quite basic currently. Eventually I am planning to add e-mail notifications and live charting in D3.js.

Available fields are in-flux, looking for recommendations of the best things to track in this online system.
